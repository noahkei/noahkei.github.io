Hello! Welcome to Noah Kei's website! I am a MI graduate (HCDS & ISD) at the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto. 

My research interest focuses on technologies that bolster our increasingly fragile democracies. From designing community-based sociotechnical system, combatting against misinformation, to exploring alternative economies that sustain democratic structures, I am dedicated to creating effective social technologies and sociotechnical practices in risk management that addresses collective vulnerablities and promotes sustainability in democratic socities. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vera Khovanskaya](https://verakhovanskaya.github.io/) on my master's thesis and by Professor [Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com/) on my diasporic Hong Kong project as part of the [Socio-Technical Resistance and Ethical Technologies (STREET) Lab](https://www.streetlab.tech/). The two kind and beautiful souls who showed me the world by teaching me how to read and write!

My master's thesis examines how diasporic organizers interacts with data practices, focusing on management of privacy, organized norms, and strategic coordination that occurs beyond the designed affordances of digital platforms. The diasporic Hong Kong project is an empirical study published at two peer reviewed venues, one on conceptualizing digital safety and risk at [ACM Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)]([https://link.springer.com/journal/10606](https://dl.acm.org/conference/cscw)) 2026, and the other on digital identity construction at [The Information Society(TIS)]([[https://academic.oup.com/JOC?login=true](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rics20)](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/utis20)). 

I am also excited to be part of the surveillance capitalism project led by Nils Bonfils under supervision of Professor [Christoph Becker](https://www.christoph-becker.info/).  

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science and Information Systems from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Business Administration - Management Sciences from the City University of Hong Kong. Prior to graduate school, I worked in various sectors ranging from banks, stock exchange, Bloomberg, telecom, semiconductor, and volunteered mostly for pro-bono consulting, fundraising, and teaching disadvantaged students English.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you are staying well. If you have any questions or if there’s anything I can assist you with, please do not hesitate to reach out!
